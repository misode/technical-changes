pack breaking obsolete | Data pack format has been increased to 55.

feature-flag pack | Removed feature flag `bundle`.

entity breaking | Removed the `boat` and `chest_boat` entity types. They are replaced with separate entities for each wood type, in the format of `[wood]_boat` and `[wood]_chest_boat`.

block block-entity nbt breaking | The `Lock` field on containers has been renamed to `lock`, and now accepts an item predicate instead of a string.

tag data | Added item tag `map_invisibility_equipment` for items that hide player markers on maps when equipped.

predicate breaking | Removed the `minecraft:boat` entity sub-predicate.
