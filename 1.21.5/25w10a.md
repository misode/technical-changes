pack breaking obsolete | Data pack format has been increased to 70.

pack breaking obsolete | Resource pack format has been increased to 54.

data entity | Added `custom_data` entity component with a `data` field to all entities. Stored only when non-empty.

predicate entity | Added optional `predicates` field to entity predicates to match partial contents on entity components. Functionality and format is identical to item predicates' `predicates` field.

predicate block | Added optional `components` and `predicates` fields to block predicates to match exact and partial contents on entity components, respectively. Functionality and format is identical to item predicates' `predicates` field.

nbt | Added `bool(arg)` and `uuid(str)` operations to SNBT.

nbt breaking | Implicit inline float values in SNBT (such as `1e1000`) are now rejected.

gamerule | Added `tntExplodes` gamerule, which defaults to `true`. When `false`, tnt cannot explode nor be primed.

shader | Global uniforms may be defined in any shader. The type of uniform must match what it would normally be.
