dialog | Changed input control type `text`.
* Contents with special characters will be escaped to fit in a SNBT literal in the output (note: both ' and " are escaped).
* For the `multiline` field: If the `height` field is omitted, but `max_lines` is present, the height that will be chosen to fit the maximum number of lines can't exceed `512`.
