blockstate | Added `align_items_to_bottom` block state property to the Shelf block
* If `false` the items on the Shelf will ignore the vertical translation of the `on_shelf` item display transform and will be rendered vertically aligned to the middle of the Shelf
* If `true` the items on the Shelf will be rendered upward from the bottom of the Shelf and will respect the vertical translation of the `on_shelf` item display transform
* Default is `false` (items are aligned to the middle of the Shelf)

attribute | `run_command` Click Event
* Previously, if the `command` field contained a command that required a signed message (`/say`, `/me`, `/msg`, `/tell`, `/w`, `/teammsg`, `/tm`), it would be silently discarded
* Instead, a screen will be shown that lets the user insert the command into the chat window or copy the command to their clipboard if the chat window can't be opened

enchantment | New field: `block_effects` - specifies per-block particles. Each block particle is randomly chosen according to weights. A set limit of block particles is spawned each tick from all explosions that tick.
* Format: List of entries:
  * `weight`: Non-negative integer representing the random weight for this entry being chosen
  * `particle`: The particle to spawn
  * `scaling`: Optional scaling to apply between explosion center and block position, or `1.0` if not specified
  * `speed`: Optional scaling to apply to the speed of the particle, or `1.0` if not specified
