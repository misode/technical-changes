pack breaking | Data pack format has been increased to 19.

text | Plain-text chat components are now always serialized as strings instead of `{"text': "blah"}`

text network | Chat components serialize to NBT when sent over network.

text | Chat components have an optional `type` value (`text`, `translatable`, `score`, `nbt`, `keybind`).

text | In chat components, the `id` field for `show_entity` `hoverEvent` style accepts UUID as an array of four ints.

text | Numeric and boolean arguments for `translate` component are no longer converted to string.

text breaking | The JSON components of `null` and `[]` are no longer accepted in chat components.

text | Errors in following chat component style fields are no longer silently ignored:
* `color`
* `clickEvent`
* `hoverEvent`
* `hoverEvent[action=show_entity].contents.name`
* `hoverEvent[action=show_item].contents.tag`

data tag | Added entity tag `can_breathe_under_water`, which disables drowning damage.

data tag damage-type | Added damage type tag `can_break_armor_stands`, which can incrementally knock down armor stands.

jar | A new `block_type` registry was added. They seem to not exist in full, and are not yet exposed to datapacks.
