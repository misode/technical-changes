particle | Added particle type `shriek`. It has a single int parameter `delay`.

particle | Removed block position parameter `origin` from particle type `vibration`. It now only has a position parameter `destination` and an int parameter `arrival_in_ticks`.

nbt entity | Added warden NBT field `anger`, which is an object with a single field `suspect`. This is map from UUID to int, this currently does not serialize correctly. 

nbt entity | Added optional field to effect and potion NBT `FactorCalculationData`, which is an object with the following fields: `padding_duration` (int), `factor_target` (float), `factor_current` (float), `effect_changed_timestamp` (int), `factor_previous_frame` (float), and `had_effect_last_tick` (boolean)

nbt entity | Added player NBT field `warden_spawn_tracker`. It has 3 int fields: `ticks_since_last_warning`, `warning_level`, and `cooldown_ticks`.

nbt entity memory | Added memory module types `recent_projectile`, `is_sniffing`, `is_emerging`, `roar_sound_delay`, `dig_cooldown`, `roar_sound_cooldown`, `sniff_cooldown`, `touch_cooldown`, and `vibration_cooldown`.

worldgen | Removed density function `slide`. Instead a combination of `add`, `mul` and `y_clamped_gradient` is used to achieve the same result.

worldgen | Removed noise settings fields `noise.sampling`, `noise.top_slide`, and `noise.bottom_slide`. Instead these configurations are moved to density functions.

worldgen | Added fields to `old_blended_noise` density function: `xz_scale`, `y_scale`, `xz_factor`, `y_factor`, and `smear_scale_multiplier`.

worldgen structure | Added field to `jigsaw` structure: `max_distance_from_center`, which is an int between 1 and 128.

worldgen | Foliage placers will now always waterlog the blocks when replacing water, if the foliage block has a waterlogged block state.
