pack breaking | Data pack format has been increased to `84.0`.

pack breaking | Resource pack format has been increased to `66.0`.

command | Added `fetchprofile` command for downloading player profiles. Works asynchronously and prints results when finished. Syntax:
* `fetchprofile name <player name>` - resolves profile by name (case-insensitive).
* `fetchprofile id <uuid>` - resolves profile by id.

blockstate block-entity nbt | Replaced `align_items_to_bottom` shelf block state property with an equally named boolean field on the block entity.

component block-entity breaking | The `profile` data component no longer resolve profiles. It now has two behaviors:
* Static: when it has `properties` field or when both `name` and `id` are present or when both are missing.
* Dynamic: when it has either `name` or `id` (but not both).

block-entity breaking | Changed `skull` block entity. The `profile` field has been changed to match the `profile` data component. It is also now immutable and is resolved only when necessary.

text | Changed the `object` text component. Bold and italics styles are now ignored when drawing sprite.
