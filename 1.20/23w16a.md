pack breaking | Data pack format has been increased to 14.

command | Added the `/return` command, with syntax: `/return <value>` where value is an integer.

advancement | Added trigger `recipe_crafted`. It has two conditions: `recipe_id` (resource location) and `ingredients` (list of item predicates).

entity | `item_display` items have been rotated 180 degrees around the Y axis to better match the transformation applied when rendering items on an armor stand head and in item frames.

tag data | Added item tag `villager_plantable_seeds` which determines the crops that villagers can place on farmland.

tag data | Added block tag `maintains_farmland` to control the blocks that keep farmland from turning to dirt during random ticks. Solid blocks above will still instantly turn farmland to dirt.
