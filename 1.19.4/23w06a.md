Removed fields `is_projectile, is_explosion`, `bypasses_armor`, `bypasses_invulnerability`, `bypasses_magic`, `is_fire`, `is_magic`, and `is_lightning`. Added new field `tags` which is a list of objects, each containting two fields: `id` (id of damage type tag) and `expected` (boolean).

* `message_id`: String used for the translation message `death.attack.{message_id}.message`.
* `exhaustion`: Float.
* `scaling`: One of `never`, `always`, `when_caused_by_living_non_player`.
* `effects`: Optional. One of `hurt`, `thorns`, `drowning`, `burning`, `poking`, or `freezing`.
* `death_message_type`: Optional. `default`, `fall_variants`, or `intentional_game_design`.

They share common tags: `transformation`, `interpolation_duration`, `interpolation_start`, `billboard`, `view_range`, `shadow_radius`, `shadow_strength`, `width`, `height`, `glow_color_override`, `brightness`.
* `block_display`: Has field `block_state`.
* `item_display`: Has fields `item` and `item_display`.
* `text_display`: Has fields `line_width`, `text_opacity`, `background`, `shadow`, `see_through`, `default_background`, `alignment`, and `text`.
