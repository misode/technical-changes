resources | Slots for the gamemode selector are now 26 pixels wide instead of 25.

pack breaking | Resource pack format has been increased to 7.

level | Entities are now saved separately from chunks in the `entities` directory, similar to the POI storage.

loot item-modifier | Added function `set_banner_pattern`. It has two fields:
* `patterns` array of objects, each having `pattern` (for example `square_bottom_left`), and `color` (for example `light_gray`).
* `append` optional boolean. If true, new elements will be appended to existing ones.
