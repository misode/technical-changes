pack breaking obsolete | Data pack format has been increased to 13.

text command breaking | Click commands on Signs can now only be invoked when the Sign is waxed, existing signs will no longer run the command when clicked.

block nbt breaking | Changed NBT of signs. Removed tags `Text1`, `Text2`, `Text3`, and `Text4`. Added tags `front_text` and `back_text`, each an object with tags: `has_glowing_text` (boolean), `color` (string), and `messages` (list of 4 text components). Additionally added a tag `is_waxed` (boolean).

loot item-modifier | Added dynamic drop `shards` option for the `name` field of the the `dynamic` loot table entry. It drops the shards of a decorated pot.

feature-flag pack | Removed feature flag `update_1_20`.

worldgen structure | Added structure processor `capped`, which limits the number of replaced blocks for a structure piece to a configured maximum. It has fields `delegate` (structure processor) and `limit` (int provider).

worldgen | Removed field `output_nbt` from the `rule` structure processor. Added `block_entity_modifier` as replacement. It takes a block entity modifier, which is an object that can be one of 4 types:
* `clear`: Completely clears the block NBT.
* `passthrough`: A no-op, leaves the block NBT without any modifications.
* `append_static`: Merges the block NBT with a static compound using a field `data`, similar to the old `output_nbt`.
* `append_loot`: Sets the `LootTable` and `LootTableSeed` NBT tags using a field `loot_table`.
