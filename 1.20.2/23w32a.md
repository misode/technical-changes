* `Duration` -> `duration` (mob effect instances)
* `ShowParticles` -> `show_particles` (mob effect instances)
* `ShowIcon` -> `show_icon` (mob effect instances)
* `HiddenEffect` -> `hidden_effect` (mob effect instances)
* `FactorCalculationData` -> `factor_calculation_data` (mob effect instances)
* `CustomPotionEffects` -> `custom_potion_effects` (`potion`, `lingering_potion`, `splash_potion`, `tipped_arrow`, `arrow`)
* `Effects` -> `effects` (`suspicious_stew`, `area_effect_cloud`)
* `EffectId` -> `id` (`suspicious_stew`)
* `EffectDuration` -> `duration` (`suspicious_stew`)
* `EffectId` and `EffectDuration` -> `stew_effects` (`mooshroom`)
* `ActiveEffects` -> `active_effects` (`player`, `armor_stand`, mobs)
* `Primary` -> `primary_effect` (`beacon`)
* `Secondary` -> `secondary_effect` (`beacon`)
