pack breaking obsolete | Data pack format has been increased to `92.0`.

pack breaking obsolete | Resource pack format has been increased to `72.0`.

network breaking | Minecraft Server Management Protocol version has been increased to `2.0.0`.

network breaking | In Server Management Protocol `typed_game_rule` and `untyped_game_rule` schemas, the `value` field type has been changed from string to boolean or integer, and now uses the game rule resource location as the key.

network | Added support for KQueue on macOS to improve network connection performance.

command | The `worldborder` command `time` argument for setting size can now specify seconds or in-game days using an `s` or `d` suffix.

command | The `worldborder` command `time` argument for setting warning distance now specifies ticks by default but can also specify seconds or in-game days using an `s` or `d` suffix.

gamerule breaking | Game rules have been moved into a registry and renamed from camel case names to resource locations in snake case.

gamerule breaking | The following game rules have been renamed: `announceAdvancements` to `show_advancement_messages`, `commandBlocksEnabled` to `command_blocks_work`, `command_modification_block_limit` to `max_block_modifications`, `disableElytraMovementCheck` to `elytra_movement_check` (value inverted), `disablePlayerMovementCheck` to `player_movement_check` (value inverted), `disableRaids` to `raids` (value inverted), `doDaylightCycle` to `advance_time`, `doEntityDrops` to `entity_drops`, `doImmediateRespawn` to `immediate_respawn`, `doInsomnia` to `spawn_phantoms`, `doLimitedCrafting` to `limited_crafting`, `doMobLoot` to `mob_drops`, `doMobSpawning` to `spawn_mobs`, `doPatrolSpawning` to `spawn_patrols`, `doTileDrops` to `block_drops`, `doTraderSpawning` to `spawn_wandering_traders`, `doVinesSpread` to `spread_vines`, `doWardenSpawning` to `spawn_wardens`, `doWeatherCycle` to `advance_weather`, `maxCommandChainLength` to `max_command_sequence_length`, `maxCommandForkCount` to `max_command_forks`, `naturalRegeneration` to `natural_health_regeneration`, `snowAccumulationHeight` to `max_snow_accumulation_height`, `spawnRadius` to `respawn_radius`, and `spawnerBlocksEnabled` to `spawner_blocks_work`.

gamerule | Some game rules now have limited value ranges: `max_block_modifications` (minimum 1), `max_command_forks` (minimum 1), `max_command_sequence_length` (minimum 0), `max_entity_cramming` (minimum 1), `max_snow_accumulation_height` (minimum 0, maximum 8), `players_nether_portal_creative_delay` (minimum 0), `players_nether_portal_default_delay` (minimum 0), `players_sleeping_percentage` (minimum 0), `random_tick_speed` (minimum 0), and `respawn_radius` (minimum 0).

gamerule | Added `fire_spread_radius_around_player` game rule to control maximum distance in blocks that fire can spread around a player. Replaces `doFireTick` and `allowFireTicksAwayFromPlayer` game rules. Setting to `0` disables fire spreading, `-1` allows fire spreading without players around.

game-test breaking | In the `game_rules` test environment, the keys `bool_rule` and `int_rule` have been replaced with a single `rules` key. It is a map from game rule resource locations to values (integer or boolean depending on the game rule).

data breaking | Renamed `visual/water_fog_radius` Environment Attribute to `visual/water_fog_end_distance`.

data breaking | Removed `visual/extra_fog` Environment Attribute.

data breaking | Replaced `visual/cloud_opacity` Environment Attribute with `visual/cloud_color`.

data | Added `visual/water_fog_start_distance` Environment Attribute to control distance in blocks from camera at which underwater fog starts. Format: float, defaults to `-8.0`. If negative, fog starts that many blocks behind the camera.

data | Added `visual/fog_start_distance` Environment Attribute to control distance in blocks from camera at which fog starts when not submerged. Format: float, defaults to `0.0`. If negative, fog starts that many blocks behind the camera.

data | Added `visual/fog_end_distance` Environment Attribute to control distance in blocks from camera at which fog reaches maximum density when not submerged. Format: non-negative float, defaults to `1024.0`.

data | Added `visual/sky_fog_end_distance` Environment Attribute to control distance in blocks from camera at which sky fog reaches maximum density when not submerged. Format: non-negative float, defaults to `512.0`. Restricted by Render Distance option.

data | Added `visual/cloud_fog_end_distance` Environment Attribute to control distance in blocks from camera at which cloud fog reaches maximum density when not submerged. Format: non-negative float, defaults to `2048.0`. Restricted by Cloud Distance option.

data | Added `visual/cloud_color` Environment Attribute to control color of clouds. Format: ARGB color, defaults to `#00000000`. If fully transparent, clouds are disabled and happy ghasts will not regenerate health faster at cloud height.

data | Added slot sources to allow location of any inventory slot to be specified within data packs. Format: object with `type` field and additional type-specific fields.

data | Added `empty` slot source type that provides an empty selection containing no slots.

data | Added `group` slot source type that merges several slot sources into one. Format: `terms` field with list of slot sources. Can be written inline as a list of slot sources.

data | Added `slot_range` slot source type that selects slots within a slot range from entity or block entity inventory. Format: `source` (loot context entity/block entity) and `slots` (slot range like `armor.chest` or `container.*`).

data | Added `contents` slot source type that selects all non-empty slots from inventory component of items. Format: `component` (inventory component to target) and `slot_source` (slot source containing items to target). Allowed components: `bundle_contents`, `charged_projectiles`, and `container`.

data | Added `filtered` slot source type that applies a filter to selected slots. Format: `item_filter` (item predicate) and `slot_source` (slot source to filter).

data | Added `limit_slots` slot source type that limits number of slots provided. Format: `limit` (integer maximum) and `slot_source` (slot source to limit).

loot | Added `slots` loot pool entry that provides items contained within selected slots to the loot table. Format: `slot_source` field describing item locations. Supports all standard loot pool entry fields.

loot breaking | Removed `contents` as a supported value for dynamic loot entry type. Its behavior is now replicated by the `slots` loot entry type with `slot_range` slot source.

worldgen | Biome `effects` color fields now support colors as a string in the form `#rrggbb` or a float array in the form `[red, green, blue]`. Affected fields: `water_color`, `foliage_color`, `dry_foliage_color`, `grass_color`, and `grass_color_modifier`.

tag | Added `#camel_husk_food` item tag for items that can feed a camel husk.

tag | Added `#can_float_while_ridden` entity tag for entities that can float on water while being ridden.

tag | Changed `#skeletons` entity tag to include parched.

tag | Changed `#zombies` entity tag to include zombie nautilus, zombie horse, and camel husk.

tag | Changed `#can_equip_saddle` entity tag to include nautilus, zombie nautilus, zombie horse, and camel husk.

shader | Added `block.vsh/fsh` shaders that copy `terrain.vsh/fsh` and handle ad-hoc blocks held by entities.

shader | Added `ChunkSection` uniform used by `terrain.vsh` which replaces `DynamicTransforms`.

shader | Added `animate_sprite*` core shaders for GPU-based sprite animations using new `SpriteAnimationInfo` uniform.

shader | The `Globals` uniform now has camera coordinates.

assets | Sprites (textures as part of a larger atlas) are now animated on the GPU rather than per-tick on the CPU. For regular frame-based animations, `animate_sprite.vsh` and `animate_sprite_blit.fsh` are used. For interpolated animations, `animate_sprite.vsh` and `animate_sprite_interpolate.fsh` are used.

assets | The UBO `SpriteAnimationInfo` contains information on where the sprite should be drawn to within the greater texture atlas.

assets | Added item sprites: `camel_husk_spawn_egg` and `parched_spawn_egg`.

assets | Added entity textures: `entity/camel/camel_husk.png`, `entity/equipment/camel_husk_saddle/saddle.png`, `entity/skeleton/parched.png`, and `entity/skeleton/parched_overlay.png`.

sound breaking | Removed `item.underwater_saddle.equip` sound event.

sound | Added sound events for nautilus: `item.nautilus_saddle_equip` and `item.nautilus_saddle_underwater_equip`.
