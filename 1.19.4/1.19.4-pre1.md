pack breaking obsolete | Resource pack format has been increased to 13.

assets | The enchantment glint now has two separate texture files: `enchanted_glint_entity.png` and `enchanted_glint_item.png`.

command | Added exectute sub command `execute positioned over`, with syntax: `execute positioned over <heightmap>`. Heightmap has the following options:
* `world_surface`: Any non-air block.
* `motion_blocking`: Any motion blocking material (e.g. ignores flowers and grass).
* `motion_blocking_no_leaves`: Any non-leaf motion blocking material.
* `ocean_floor`: Any non-fluid motion blocking material.

data damage-type tag | Added damage tag `bypasses_cooldown`. Damage types with this tag bypass the regular invincibility time after taking damage. This tag is not used in vanilla, so you won't find this in the vanilla data pack!

data damage-type tag | Added damage tag `always_hurts_ender_dragons`.

data tag | Added entity type tag `fall_damage_immune`. Entity types with this tag do not take fall damage.

data tag | Added block and item tag `smelts_to_glass`, used by the glass smelt recipe.
