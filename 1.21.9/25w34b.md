component block-entity | Player profiles in data components and block entities no longer resolve automatically

command | Added `fetchprofile` command for downloading player profiles
* New command that has been added to fetch the contents of a player profile from Minecraft servers
* Since the operation might take some time, it works asynchronously
  * Results will be printed only when operation finishes, but the game will keep running unpaused
* After successful completion, a message will be printed that lets users copy the contents of a fully resolved `minecraft:profile` component or `/give @s minecraft:player_head` with said component
* Since the result is not known at the time of execution, this command always returns `1`
* Syntax:
  * `fetchprofile name <player name>` - resolves profile by name (case-insensitive)
  * `fetchprofile id <uuid>` - resolves profile by id

blockstate | Removed `align_items_to_bottom` block state property from Shelf block
* It has been replaced with an equally named boolean field on the Shelf block entity
* Shelves created with this property set in the last snapshot will reset back to the default value (`false`)

component | Modified `minecraft:profile`
* Previously contents of this component would permanently change when profile was resolved, i.e. downloaded from Minecraft service 
* To avoid issues with this unexpected change, the resolved value is no longer stored and contents of the profile will always remain unchanged 
* That means this component has now two behaviors:
  * Static: when it has `properties` field or when both `name` and `id` are present or when both are missing
    * In this state, profile will always render as-is
    * If `properties` field is missing, a default skin will be used (selected based on `id`, same as in offline mode)
    * That means skin will be frozen at the moment of component creation
    * This option is preferred for decorational uses
  * Dynamic: when it has either `name` or `id` (but not both)
    * When an item containing this profile is rendered on the client side, the profile will be resolved to most recent value
    * This means that this item will always render with current skin of targeted player
      * Note: if a player changes skin while game is running, change will not be visible unless clients restart
    * Resolution might happen with a delay, during which item will render with a default skin
    * Profile name will replace item name only when it's present
      * Items with just `id` will show default name
    * Items will dynamic profiles be distinguished from static ones with label in tooltip
* Items stack based on exact contents, so even if a dynamic component is eventually resolved to the same profile as a static one, they won't stack together
* Player heads in older maps that have not been loaded in never versions yet will usually be converted to dynamic contents

block-entity | Modified `minecraft:skull`
* `profile` field has been changed to match `minecraft:profile` component
  * That means that it also becomes immutable and is resolved only when necessary

text | Bold and italics styles are ignored when drawing sprites
